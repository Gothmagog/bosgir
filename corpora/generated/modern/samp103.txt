Get creative  | She let out a small chuckle, taking a step back to survey her work. She thought to herself for a moment before turning to her assistant.
You've got this  | He gave a small smile, a bit of confidence seemingly returning to him. "Ok, I understand," he said, and returned to his work, focusing on the task at hand.

Show me | She opened up her leather backpack, revealing a multitude of gadgets and devices.

Go to sleep: | 
Time to sleep | He crawled into bed and turned off the lamp, the soft glow of the nightlight casting a peaceful hue on the walls. Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and felt sleep begin to take over. 
Make it stop: | 
Stop it! | The woman let out a blood-curdling scream as the figure moved in for the kill, but then something incredible happened: Time seemed to freeze as all movement in the room came to a complete stop.
I want the truth: | 
Be honest, and tell me the truth! | She clenched her fists, a mix of determination and vulnerability on her face. She looked at him and said, "This is the truth, even if it hurts".
Run! | 
Run! | The ground rumbled beneath them as the lava started to spew out of the volcano. The group turned and fled for their lives, the searing heat chasing them as they raced across the rocky terrain.
You need to lie to your mom and tell her I'm not here. | I know, honey. But you have to do this for me. Tell her that I'll be back later and that you don't know where I went. 
Answer the door: | 
Answer that! | He shouted these words as he saw the unopened door rattle slightly from a loud knock.

Discover the truth, no matter the cost | Tell me, Doctor. I must know the truth about what's happening to me, even if it's dangerous."

Find the envelope. | He searched the mess on the table, the cup holder, the glove compartment, under the newspapers, and in all the drawers, desperate to find the small off-white envelope somewhere.
Check screens. | She flicked on the televisions and her computer, checking for any news, any alerts, anything that might give her a clue as to what she should do next. 
Open it.  | The brown letter inside, sealed and bearing an unfamiliar crest, was unexpected, and when he opened it a small key fell out into his hand. 
Hear them.  | I listened for any sounds, any signs that he was still here, but all I could hear was the low hum of the air conditioning. 
Force the door.  | The door was stuck, but with a grunt and a shove, he forced it open, the wood splintering and giving way as the hinges squealed in protest. 
Check behind you.  | He could hear the footsteps quicken, so he checked behind him; they were close, too close, and he had no choice but to keep moving. 
Leave.  | It was clear we weren't welcome here, not after what had just happened, so we timed our exit, ducking out the back door and into the night. 
Shut it.  | She shut the door quietly behind her, making sure not to slam it and possibly draw any unwanted attention to herself. 
Exit the building.  | He left the building, walking briskly to where his car was parked, glancing over his shoulder every few seconds, worried he was being followed. 
Find the group.  | She spotted the others huddled around the campfire, talking quietly, and as she approached she heard snatches of their conversation, hushed and strained. 
Keep walking | The girl didn't stop walking, despite the protests of her weary body. She knew she couldn't show any sign of weakness, not here.
Pay the man | I pulled out my wallet and handed over the cash. The large man in the corner pocketed the money and nodded, his gun disappearing into the folds of his coat. 
Say nothing | She stared at the gun in the detective's hand, her mouth dry as the desert sands. She said nothing, the words caught in her throat like a boulder.
Pick it up | I extended my arm and carefully picked up the fragile piece of pottery with two fingers. The ancient relic had been hidden from sight for centuries, waiting to be discovered. 
Show them who's boss | I walked into the conference room, a no-nonsense expression on my face. The team was murmuring amongst themselves, their uncertainty radiating like a virus. I slammed my briefcase onto the table, and the room fell silent. 
Scratch the ticket | I fumbled for my ticket, my hand shaking like a leaf. The numbers blurred together as I tried to focus on them. Was it really my lucky day? I scratched at the silver coating, revealing row after row of matching numbers. 
Call in backup | I had to get out of here. The door slammed behind me, and I ran for the exit. I fumbled for my phone in my pocket, dialing the familiar number with trembling fingers. 
Get creative | The paintbrush hovered in the air for a moment, as if suspended by some invisible force. The artist had been staring at the blank canvas for hours now, the creative block looming over them like a dark cloud. 
Show them the photo | My hands shook as I held out the cracked phone screen for them to see. The image was clear as day, the two people occupying the frame unmistakable. 
Don't look back | Her eyes stung as the wind ripped through her hair, blinding her from the chaos unfolding behind her. Don't look back, she told herself. But she couldn't help herself. She glanced in the rearview mirror, and her heart stopped. 
Tell a little white lie | The truth tasted like vinegar in my mouth, but I needed an excuse to leave this party. I scanned the room, spotting my best friend chatting away with my ex-boyfriend in the corner. "Sorry, I have a migraine," I lied, using my best smile to cover up the lie. 
Open the box | The look on his face was priceless. He had been certain that the gift was for him, that he had been the one to find the hidden treasure. But the box was still sealed shut, taunting him with its secrets.
Wave goodbye | I watched them leave the party, the weight of my body heavy as I stood there alone. The music swelled, and the crowd seemed to move in slow motion as my eyes followed them to the door. 
Save the best for last | I took a deep breath and jumped, plunging into the icy water below. The cold shock nearly paralyzed me, but I fought my way to the surface. I scanned the area around me, searching for the next checkpoint. 
Don't let them see you | I ducked behind the nearest car, trying to catch my breath. My lungs burned, and my legs were starting to give out. But I knew I had to keep going, to push myself to move faster. 
Put it back | The book slipped out of my hands, its worn spine cracking as it landed on the carpet. I bent down to retrieve it, my fingers trembling as I picked up the heavy tome. 
Walk away | I took a step back, my body tense as I prepared to flee. I could hear their footsteps, the sound of their whispers carrying through the air like a plague. 
Stay | The world faded away around me as I stared into the blackness, the silence wrapping around me like a blanket. I sat there, motionless, for what felt like an eternity.

Show everyone  | Check this out!" He said as he held up his phone, showing everyone in the cafeteria the photo he had just taken. 
Climb the tree  | The boy carefully scaled the thick trunk and sat on a sturdy branch, looking out over the city below. 
Listen to the message  | I think it's from him," he said, listening to the voicemail message for the third time, "but I'm not sure."

Give me five  | He counted out the bills, laying each one on the table. 
Turn around, don't look  | I tried to move slowly, turning my head to face the wall, avoiding eye contact as I passed. 
Stop the car  | Bad news," he said, slamming on the brakes and bringing the car to a jarring halt. 
Go back inside  | They took off their heavy coats and shook the snow from their boots before stepping back into the cozy warmth of the cabin.

Answer the phone  | The character looked at the screen, seeing the name of their boss and feeling a knot in their stomach, knowing that the call likely meant bad news. 
Accept the challenge  | He smirked and threw up his hands, challenging the other man to a friendly duel, accepting the bet with the secret knowledge that he had a hidden card up his sleeve. 
Open the envelope  | She sliced the letter opener across the top of the thick, cream-colored envelope, revealing a stack of crisp, hundred-dollar bills, more money than she had ever seen in one place. 
Close your eyes  | They closed their eyes and took a deep breath, attempting to clear their mind of all thoughts, before opening their eyes again and looking at the mess before them, knowing that they had to get back to work. 
Feel it | The character slowly ran their hands over the soft, woven fabric, closing their eyes to better focus on the intricate pattern, taking a moment to appreciate the craftsmanship.
Quick, fix the camera  | Get the camera positioned correctly, we need to be able to get a clear shot of the proceedings.
Turn off the flashlight  | The light must be off so that we remain undetected.
Look out!  | 
No time to think  | 
Don't look back!  | 
Get out of there!  | 
Be careful" | They walked slowly, their footsteps calculated as they crept towards the door, careful not to make a sound."
Get out" | She didn't wait for him to answer, slamming the door shut and getting the hell out of there."
Duck!" | He flinched and ducked, narrowly avoiding the wild swing of the axe that was aimed at his head."
Find me somewhere safe." | You have to get out of here. I'm heading to the library to hide; you should try and find me somewhere safe nearby." 
Be ready." | With shaking hands, he steadied himself, breathing heavily, and readied himself for the final showdown."
Keep that story going." |  'And what do you think happened next?' she said, eyes wide, as the teacher nodded and gestured for her to continue her story." 
Say you're sorry." | He took a deep breath, mustering the courage to look her in the eye, and apologized for what he had done." 
Get some rest." | She finally gave in to her exhaustion and crawled into bed, the stress of the day causing her to instantly fall into a deep sleep."
Open it." | She reached out and turned the doorknob, pushing the door open and revealing the dimly lit interior of the old house."
Tell me the truth." | They looked each other in the eye and took a deep breath, then told me that yes, they would tell me the truth, no matter the cost."
Stay alert." | He stopped mid-step, listening intently, the hair on the back of his neck standing up as he realized he wasn't alone."
Don't stop." | He kept his arm moving, the needle still injecting into his skin, the rush of pleasure and relief flowing through him as the drug took hold."
Follow them." | They tailed their suspect, sticking to the shadows and staying out of sight as they made their way through the city streets."
Open your eyes." | They fluttered open, revealing a blurry world before her, the bright lights and colors of the fairgrounds slowly coming into focus as she adjusted to the sunlight."
Get out  | The man immediately leaped to his feet, following the command. The action causes him to stumble into the brighter office area, blinded by the sudden contrast after having spent hours in the dark corridor.
Don't speak  | The command causes the woman to hold her tongue, instead she stands up and takes a step towards the door, keeping her voice steady as she demands to know what they want.

Press the button  | Her finger hovered over the red button. A sense of dread washed over her as she considered the consequences of her actions. But she knew she had no other choice. With a deep breath, she pressed down hard. 
Turn off the phone | He silenced his phone and placed it face down on the table. Taking a quick glance around, he checked to make sure no one was watching.
Open the envelope  | She held the thick, white envelope up to the light, searching for any signs of tampering. Satisfied that it was safe, she carefully slid out the folded letter within.
Sit down | Taking a seat on the couch, he placed the bag of popcorn on his lap. The familiar sound of crinkling plastic filled the room as he dug in.
Press onward  | He kept on moving, trudging through the dense forest, his boots sinking into the soft earth with each step. The backpack felt heavier with each passing mile, but he knew he had to keep going.
Check the clock | She glanced at the clock on her bedside table. She needed to leave in the next 10 minutes if she wanted to make it there on time. As she jumped out of bed, she noticed her hands shaking.
Go to the fridge  | Walking over to the fridge, he opened the door and peered inside, scanning the various food items. He needed something quick and easy, something to satisfy his grumbling stomach. 
Knock on the door | She knocked firmly on the door, the sound echoing through the silent house. She could hear the TV blaring from inside, but no one came to the door. She knocked again, louder this time. 
Get into character  | She took a deep breath and focused herself. It was time to get into character. Slipping into the shoes of her character, she adjusted her posture and expression, adopting the mannerisms of the person she was about to portray.
Open the present  | She carefully tore off the wrapping paper, revealing the small, rectangular box hidden beneath. A smile crept across her face as she recognized the brand. She hadn’t expected to receive a gift, let alone one so thoughtful. 
Get out of the car  | He stepped out of the car, feeling the heat from the midday sun hit him like a wall. Looking around, he noticed the arid landscape stretched out before him, the dry, cracked earth a stark contrast to the lush, green hills in the distance.
Start the car | She sat down in the driver’s seat, adjusting the seat and the mirrors. She turned the key in the ignition, and the engine roared to life. She could hear the heavy rain beating down on the roof of the car as she gripped the steering wheel.
Throw the ball  | He wound up and reared back, ready to throw the baseball as hard as he could. He could hear the cheering crowds in the background, their voices growing louder as he focused on the pitcher’s mound. He let the ball fly, watching it soar through the air. 
Take a picture  | She grabbed her phone and positioned it in front of her, framing the shot. She wanted to capture this moment, to remember it forever. She smiled wide and pressed the button, the familiar click sounding as the camera flashed.
Hug the child | He bent down to the child’s level and smiled, seeing the traces of his own features reflected back at him. “I’ve missed you,” he said, his voice husky with held-back tears. The child nodded, and without another word, he wrapped his arms around the man, holding on tight.
Command | Check the phone.'
 | The young woman snatched the cell phone from her pocket, her shaking fingers struggling to type in the passcode. 
Command | Follow that car!'
 | The detective floored the gas pedal, the muscle car's tires squealing as they peeled away from the curb, hot on the trail of the suspect's sedan.
Command | Open the box.'
 | With a quick motion, he flipped open the ornate lid, revealing a seemingly empty interior, save for a small piece of folded paper resting at the bottom.
Command | Stop that guy!'
 | The security guard raised his service pistol and took aim, shouting a warning as he fired two shots at the fleeing thief, the bullets missing their mark but causing the suspect to stumble and fall. 
Command | Say the truth.'
 | It was an accident, I swear," she said, her voice wavering as she struggled to meet the detective's steely gaze, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.
Command | Get out!'
 | With a surge of adrenaline, he pushed open the door and fled the smoke-filled room, the sounds of the raging fire encroaching behind him.
Command | Pay the driver.'
 | She handed over two crisp hundred-dollar bills, wincing as the taxi driver counted the money with a skeptical eye, before grumbling something under his breath and slamming the car door shut.
Command | Hide in the bushes.'
 | He crouched low, ducking behind a leafy bush, his heart pounding as the flashlight beams passed by only inches away, the police continuing their search in the dense undergrowth.
Command | Open the envelope.'
 | Her face fell as she slit open the creamy envelope with a letter opener, the single sheet of paper within revealing the bad news in black and white.
Command | Enter the house.'
 | He stepped cautiously over the threshold, the air thick with the musty scent of abandonment, the dilapidated interior bathed in the dim glow of the streetlights outside. 
Command | Start the car.'
 | With a soft whirr, the engine coughed to life, the old pickup truck shaking slightly as he adjusted the mirrors and backed out of the driveway, the gas pedal slowly easing downward. 
Command | Get me a drink.'
 | She rose from the sofa and padded into the kitchen, opening the fridge and pouring a glass of cold water, condensation forming on the outside of the glass as she brought it back to her guest. 
Command | Dig faster.'
 | The teenage boy, covered in sweat and grime, redoubled his efforts, the shovel slicing through the soil with ease, the hole now large enough to accommodate the sizeable chest he was digging.
Command | Don't look back.'
 | She focused her gaze straight ahead, her steps deliberate as she navigated the dimly lit hallway, the sounds of her pursuer's footsteps growing fainter, until all she could hear was her own rapid breathing.
Command | Say you're sorry.'
 | I'm so sorry, honey," he said, kneeling down to look his daughter in the eyes, his voice cracking, as he took full responsibility for his actions.
Command | Get me a receipt.'
 | With a few quick keystrokes, the transaction was completed, and a digital receipt was sent to her email. She clicked the "print" button and watched as the receipt slowly came to life from the inkjet printer on her desk.
Command | Say hello.'
 | We exchanged nervous glances, and my voice cracked as I greeted the distinguished guest, the sound of my own words echoing awkwardly in the grand marble atrium.
Command | Open the door.'
 | With a jolt, she woke from her slumber, the alarm blaring, and she quickly reached over to silence it. The hotel room was eerily dark, the door slightly ajar, the flickering lights of the hallway beyond illuminating the carpet. 
Command | Tell me the truth.'
 | I don't know what to say," he admitted, his voice barely audible over the crashing waves, "except that I love you and I never wanted to hurt you."
Command | Show me the picture.'
 | The nurse held up the X-ray image, and we both stared at the black-and-white image on the screen, the cancer's metastasis ominously clear, confirming our worst fears. 
Look for clues | Her eyes darted around the dimly lit room as she searched for anything that may have been a clue to where the hidden exit was. 
Read the file | The stack of documents on the table seemed endless, but he read every page thoroughly, determined to find any scrap of information that could be relevant to the case. 
Search the building | He entered each room methodically, his gun drawn, checking every corner, under every bed, and behind every door, hoping to find the fugitive before it was too late. 
Contact the witness | She dialled the number on the card, her heart racing as she listened to the phone ring, hoping against hope that the witness would pick up and agree to meet with them. 
Find a way to escape | He looked around desperately, searching for any means of escape, his mind racing as he weighed the possibilities: jump out the window, try to bust through the door, or maybe find an alternate exit? 
Stand your ground | The monster advanced toward him, its enormous wings blocking out the sun, its venomous hiss filling the air. Mike kept his nerve, his gun raised, standing his ground, knowing that running would only make things worse. 
Open the package | Her hands trembled as she held the small box in her lap, unsure of what she might find inside. With a deep breath, she gingerly lifted the lid, revealing a cloud of fine white powder that immediately triggered an allergic reaction.
