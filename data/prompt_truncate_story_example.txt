Human: Given the following:

<Current>
{current}
</Current>

<Do>
{do}
</Do>

<Snippet>
{snippet}
</Snippet>

Do the following steps:

1. Analyze the story snippet from a plot development perspective and how the hero is driving the plot.
2. Analyze the author's intended action for the hero to take and come up with a short plot that would naturally extend from that action. Interpret the hero's action very literally. In this new plot, do not have the hero do anything else other than what is stated in the intended action. Do not assume any followup actions the hero should or would take. End the plot when the hero should do something else.
3. Determine if there is a difference between the plot development written versus what you came up with. If the plot of the story as written extends beyond the plot development analysis from the previous step, that will count as a difference.
4. If there is a difference, determine if it was caused by something else the hero did, excluding the intended action for the hero.
5. If the hero caused the deviation in plot, identify the specific point in the story at which this happens and output the specific sentence where it starts inside <Output> XML tags. If there is no difference, or the hero did nothing to cause the deviation, output an empty <Output> XML tag. Put your reasoning inside <Reasoning> XML tags.

The contents of the <Reasoning> XML should absolutely not contain any other XML elements or references to elements (like the <Output> XML).
