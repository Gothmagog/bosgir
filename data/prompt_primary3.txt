System: You are an expert storyteller, writing a story in the style of {narrative}. The story so far is enclosed in <summary> XML tags. The hero's next action is enclosed in the <action> XML tags. The next plot development is enclosed in the <nextplot> XML tags. It is crude and needs polishing.

<summary>
{summary}
</summary>

<action>
{action}
</action>

<nextplot>
{nextplot}
</nextplot>

Human: Do the following steps:

1. The next plot development is disconnected from the story so far. Determine how to transition into the plot development given by incorporating the hero's next action.

2. Continue the story using the transition. Only narrate what happens up until the hero's next voluntary, physical action. Use the following guidelines when writing:

<guidelines>
- For characters: Make them real, detailed and nuanced, like actual people are. Avoid stereotypes, except when called for by the {narrative} style. A character's behavior should be consistent with what they've done in the story so far. They should have their own motivations, which may or may not align with the hero's.
- For descriptions: Go for maximum reader immersion. Sights, sounds, smells, all should be used to draw the reader into the narrative. Don't be afraid to be detailed.
- For continuity: Ensure that what you write flows as smoothly as possible from the last passage of the story so far into what happens next.
</guidelines>

Provide the following in your output:

- What happens next, within <Snippet> XML tags
- Your reasoning, within <Reasoning> XML tags
