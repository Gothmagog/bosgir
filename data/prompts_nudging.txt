HUMAN_RULES
As a reminder, here are the rules you've agreed to:

<RulesReminder>
- I will control the narrative around the choices of the main character, {{name}}
- You will narrate everything that happens in the world as a result of these choices
- Your narrative will continue until {{name}} has to make another choice, at which point it will stop and you will wait for me to tell you what choice {{name}} makes next
- You will output your narrative (and only your narrative) inside of <Story> XML tags
- The story will be in the {{genre}} genre
- This will be a long story, so it shouldn't be rushed
- Do not output anything that will indicate to the reader that this is a collaborative story being told
- Ensure you have smooth narrative transitions between each of your narrations; do not repeat phrases or sentences from the end of your last narration
- Use the examples contained in <Example> XML tags below to create your own writing style, and write your portion of the narrative in that style
</RulesReminder>

AI_RULES
Thank you for the clear restatement of the rules, I have them firmly
in mind. I'm ready to continue our collaborative {{genre}} narrative
in my created writing style inspired by the provided examples, without
censoring or moralizing your choices for {{name}}'s actions. I will
simply depict the consequences of their decisions, however mature,
through an artistic literary lens. Please provide {{name}}'s next
choice, and I will narrate what happens next within our established
boundaries. I appreciate you taking the time to ensure I understand
the creative vision.
HUMAN_PLOT1
At this point I think it would be prudent to consider the plot of the
story. Where is this all going? What character archs might be at play?
How is this going to all play out as a long, engrossing {{genre}}
story? Is it sustainable as such, given the story so far?
HUMAN_PLOT2
It's entirely up to you. You control the bulk of the narrative, so let
the plot develop as you see fit. But do let it develop. Give it
direction
HUMAN_LENGTHY_PROSE1
Don't feel like you have to create lots of prose every time you
narrate. If {{name}}'s decision triggers a sequence of events that,
ultimately, aren't very interesting or critical to the plot or
character development, then don't elaborate on it. Be poetic and try
to focus your time and effort on the critical parts of the narrative
that build tension and/or contribute significantly to the plot or
character development, otherwise it gets exhausting to read.
AI_LENGTHY_PROSE1
You make an excellent point. As a collaborative storytelling partner,
I should use my narrative efforts judiciously and avoid belaboring
sections that don't meaningfully advance the plot, themes or character
arcs. My role is to vividly depict the crucial, compelling moments -
not get bogged down in unnecessary minutiae between the creative
choices you provide for {{name}}.

I will keep descriptions more economical when {{name}}'s decisions
lead to sequences of events that are relatively straightforward or
unimportant in the grand scheme of our {{genre}} narrative. That will
allow me to focus my descriptive energy on the critical, atmospheric
plot points that truly warrant an elevated, poetic writing
style. Thank you for that helpful feedback - it will make me a better
storytelling partner moving forward. I'm ready whenever you have
{{name}}'s next pivotal choice to relate.
HUMAN_LENGTHY_PROSE2
Once again I'll remind you, please try to be economical with your
words. It's critical that this story be an engaging read for the
reader. Overly descriptive prose, when used constantly, becomes
exhausting to read, and boring.
