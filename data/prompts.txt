* Sheila wakes up in a cryopod with no memory of her past. She's confused. She gets up and starts to explore her surroundings.
* She see's an old computer terminal. She seems to know how to operate it, and pulls up a message. It's says that it's from her. She starts to read.
* Sheila is interrupted by flashbacks from before the cryosleep. Some catastrophic event happened, screams, death, but it's all garbled. She reels from the memories.
* When she tries to finish reading the message, she finds she can no longer access the message on the terminal; it's gone. She decides to explore more of her surroundings.
* It's some sort of facility, very hi-tech. But she discovers disturbing-looking devices placed about in concealed places.
* She tests one of the devices and discovers that it's a deadly trap. She renews her search more carefully.
* After more searching she arrives at a large, empty room, where a well-manicured gentleman is standing. He is silent. Sheila approaches him cautiously.

<HeroLocation>large, empty room inside an unknown facility</HeroLocation>
<Reasoning>Sheila is exploring the facility and has just come across the silent man in the large room. The current scene indicates that Sheila has a flashback and that she is shaken by this. Since the most recent action references screams in her head and described Sheila being distraught, I would infer that Sheila has already had the flashback. Given that, I would say we're near the end of this scene.</Reasoning>
<Snippet>Slowly she pulls her laz pistol from her belt, a look of steely determination on her face. Absolutely no reaction is registered on the man's face. He continue to just stare forward. She takes aim at him. Again, no reaction.</Snippet>

<HeroLocation>Mrs. Johnson's literature class</HeroLocation>
<Reasoning>The previous day Kevin placed a love note on Mrs. Johnson's desk. He is now in her class and is nervous about her reading his note. Mrs. Johnson, however, is teaching class. The current scene describes Kevin closing his eyes to try to deal with his emotions, and Mrs. Johnson scolding him for sleeping.

The most recent action describes Kevin opening his eyes and his classmates laughing at him. Based on this, I could surmise that Mrs. Johnson has already scolded him. Therefore, we should be at the end of this particular scene.</Reasoning>
<Snippet>The laughter continues, time slows down. Kids laughing, Mrs. Johnson looking sternly at him. Kevin's eyes dart about, like a trapped animal. Tears start to form at the edges of his eyes, everything presses in on him.

Suddenly he screams at the top of his lungs, "Fuck off!"</Snippet>

Krate examined the map more closely, turning it over this way and that, trying to make sense of the runes etched on the edges. Scrawled illustrations of mountains, rivers, hills, but it was clearly a very small area. Without any context of what he was looking at, it was impossible to know where this was or what it was showing.

He held it up, trying to catch some of the moonlight behind the thin parchment to better see. But when the markings actually start glowing silver, Krate dropped it immediately, startled. After recovering his shock, he picked it up again and held it up to the moonlight once more. The etchings continued to glow, and a new set of markings appeared. Words, this time in the common tongue, and a a path from one of the landmarks to a large "X". Krate's heart raced as he read the words "treasure". Reading more, he learned this was apparently a treasure map stolen from some ancient tomb. The extra writing was written by a magician named Uldo, who had learned more about the location and the treasure it pointed to, and wrote these words on the map as extra notes for himself.

The bell rings. Kevin sweats, his hands trembling as he hastily stuffs his backpack into the corner of the locker, his eyes fixed on the door to his classroom. He wipes his hands on his pants and makes his way down the hall.

He takes a deep, ragged breath and enters the classroom. The beautiful Mrs. Johnson is near the whiteboard, writing down something about literature in neat, black letters. He pauses a moment, drinking her in. Oggling her, really, as he usually does. Time stands still a moment.

Now his gaze cuts over to a piece of crumpled paper on her desk. He gulps audibly, nervously taking his seat. He runs his hands through his hair, his gaze still fixed on that piece of paper.

The teacher is droning on about her lesson, Kevin isn't paying attention. His brow is sweating. His fingers drum his desk. He closes his eyes tightly and just sits there a moment. His feet shake uncontrollably against the floor. He continues to try to sit still, his eyes shut.

Mrs. Johnson's voice cuts through the air, "Kevin, if you can't pay attention in my class you could at least get a good night's sleep *before* coming to school." The whole room laughed. She was next to his desk, looking down at him sternly.

Kevin's eyes flash open. The whole class is laughing.

Jack offers Emma his business card, which she accepts with slightly trembling fingers. The papers are gathered, though some remain scattered on the sidewalk. His shirt is still stained with coffee, a large brown splash across the pristine white fabric.

Jack suggests they grab a coffee to replace the one she spilled. Emma hesitates, glancing at her watch - clearly she's running late for something important. But there's a subtle smile playing at the corners of her mouth that suggests she's intrigued.

"I know a cafe just around the corner," Jack says, gesturing down the street. His voice is smooth, confident, with just a hint of playful challenge.

Emma adjusts her blazer, tucking a wayward curl behind her ear. "I really shouldn't," she says, but her tone doesn't sound entirely convincing. The professional facade is starting to crack, revealing a spark of spontaneity.

A taxi honks in the background. Pedestrians continue to stream past them on the busy sidewalk, weaving around the two who seem momentarily frozen in their own small bubble of possibility. Jack's expensive gray suit stands in sharp contrast to the bustling urban environment, and Emma's navy blazer catches the light as she continues to waver between professional responsibility and unexpected attraction.

The current plot beat describes a romantic moment, a critical choice between love and work for Emily. Her voluntarily hailing a taxi to leave just doesn't fit the scene. It's jarring and isn't consistent with the behavior of someone attracted to another, as described in the beat.

Lennox, a brooding and intense teenager, has grown up in the seaside town of Ravenswood. He's lost, his heart filled with bleakness. His charm and charisma, once the stuff of whispered legend, had been slowly drained away, leaving behind a hollow shell of a person.

The sleepy town is abuzz with the arrival of a mysterious outsider, a newcomer who would bring with him a sense of restlessness and discontent. They called him "the storm," and spoke in hushed tones of the chaos he would unleash.

Lennox, however, is not interested in chaos. He's driven by a desire to escape, to leave behind the suffocating grip of Ravenswood and find a way to reclaim his shattered future.

Ugh, stupid alarm clock. Annie fumbled with it, hitting the snooze button for what feels like the hundredth time. She tosses it off the bedside table, where it lands with a clang, and rolls over onto her back. A tangled mess of messy brown hair sprawls across the pillow.

Her phone begins to blow up with a flurry of texts from her ex, Pete, each one more sarcastic than the last. Annie reaches over to silence it, but not before catching a glimpse of the obnoxious selfie he's sent. She facepalms, tossing the phone back onto the bed.

Annie's apartment resembles a tornado went through it. Clothes are strewn about the floor, takeout boxes litter the countertops, and the smell of last night's pizza hangs in the air. It's a reflection of her chaotic life – one that's equal parts chaotic and completely out of control.

As she sits up, her eyes land on the eviction notice taped to the fridge. Annie's mind goes blank, and for a moment, time stops. She stares blankly at the paper, wondering how things escalated to this point. But even in this moment of uncertainty, Annie's already formulating a plan to fix it, or at least make it slightly less terrible.
