* She see's an old computer terminal. She seems to know how to operate it, and pulls up a message. It's says that it's from her. She starts to read.
* Sheila is interrupted by flashbacks from before the cryosleep. Some catastrophic event happened, screams, death, but it's all garbled. She reels from the memories.
* When she tries to finish reading the message, she finds she can no longer access the message on the terminal; it's gone. She decides to explore more of her surroundings.
* It's some sort of facility, very hi-tech. But she discovers disturbing-looking devices placed about in concealed places.
* She tests one of the devices and discovers that it's a deadly trap. She renews her search more carefully.
* After more searching she arrives at a large, empty room, where a well-manicured gentleman is standing. He is silent. Sheila approaches him cautiously.

Then, "Kevin Burnock, come with me!" Mrs. Johnson grabs Kevin by the arm, pulling him out of his desk, and escorts him out of the classroom.

Krate examined the map more closely, turning it over this way and that, trying to make sense of the runes etched on the edges. Scrawled illustrations of mountains, rivers, hills, but it was clearly a very small area. Without any context of what he was looking at, it was impossible to know where this was or what it was showing.

He held it up, trying to catch some of the moonlight behind the thin parchment to better see. But when the markings actually start glowing silver, Krate dropped it immediately, startled. After recovering his shock, he picked it up again and held it up to the moonlight once more. The etchings continued to glow, and a new set of markings appeared. Words, this time in the common tongue, and a a path from one of the landmarks to a large "X". Krate's heart raced as he read the words "treasure". Reading more, he learned this was apparently a treasure map stolen from some ancient tomb. The extra writing was written by a magician named Uldo, who had learned more about the location and the treasure it pointed to, and wrote these words on the map as extra notes for himself.

Kevin enters the classroom, slowly. He looks at Mrs. Johnson's desk, sees the crumpled up note he left there yesterday. Still unopened? He shuffles his way to his desk and slumps into it.

Mrs. Johnson is droning on about some writer or something. That beatufuly, silky voice of hers reaches his ears like music. Normally he would be in her thrall, but the weight of this situation is crushing him. Has she read the note? Did she like it? Will she know who it's from? What if she thinks it's stupid? It's a stupid note. A sonnet? What the hell was he thinking?

The clock ticks by at a slow march. A funeral march. Kevin sighs and slumps further into his chair. Sweat starts to form on his brow. His mind is racing, too much in his head right now.

Kevin closes his eyes shut, trying to block it all out. He tries to remember that summer vacation, walking along the railroad tracks with dad, the way the clouds looked, that old-time candy shop they stopped at...

His reverie is interrupted by the sound of Mrs. Johnson. "Kevin Burnock, if you're not going to get enough sleep at night, you could at least take a nap in someone else's class."

His eyes snap open. She's right in fron of him, those lovely arms folded in front of those lovely breasts, frowning at him. The whole class is laughing at him.

<Reasoning>Getting angry and yelling at his teacher is a logical prelude to running out of the classroom. It doesn't immediately get us there, but it fits with the action and seems appropriate to the current scene. Since we're still in the classroom, in the embarassing moment with Kevin, a new scene transition isn't quite appropriate at this point.</Reasoning>

Emma is walking briskly down the streets of downtown Manhattan. It's a busy morning, lots of pedestrians, and a cacophony of sounds. She readjusts her purse on her shoulder and looks at her watch, then quickens her pace.

Coming up on a crosswalk, the electronic "walk" sign has begun its countdown. Emma hurries and runs across the street. A skater she doesn't notice passes very close by, right in front of her, right when she gets to the other side. Emma screams a little and moves backwards, right into Jack, a young, attractive guy dressed casually.

"Woah there," he holds her shoulders.

"Oh! I'm so sorry! Did I...?"

"No no, it's fine. That guy almost--"

"Yeah," Emma glances back the way the skater left, then at Jack. She smiles a little. "Almost got turned into a pancake."

He smiles. "I'm Jack, by the way." Pedestrians continue to push past them.

"Emma." She extends her hand, they shake. Eye contact is held by both.

"Emma," he repeats. "You, uh, going somewhere?"

"Yes. Oh gosh," she exclaims, looking at her watch. "Look, I gotta--"

"Hey, uh, crazy thought: coffee? With little ole me?"

"What, now?"

"Yeah, you're right. You're obviously busy." He smiles sheepishly.

The current scene describes a romantic moment, a critical choice between love and work for Emily. Her voluntarily hailing a taxi to leave doesn't seem to fit the current scene. It suggests a transition to a more desperate desire to leave the situation on Emma's part, and so deserves its own scene.

Lennox, a brooding and intense teenager, has grown up in the seaside town of Ravenswood. He's lost, his heart filled with bleakness. His charm and charisma, once the stuff of whispered legend, had been slowly drained away, leaving behind a hollow shell of a person.

The sleepy town is abuzz with the arrival of a mysterious outsider, a newcomer who would bring with him a sense of restlessness and discontent. They called him "the storm," and spoke in hushed tones of the chaos he would unleash.

Lennox, however, is not interested in chaos. He's driven by a desire to escape, to leave behind the suffocating grip of Ravenswood and find a way to reclaim his shattered future.

Ugh, stupid alarm clock. Annie fumbled with it, hitting the snooze button for what feels like the hundredth time. She tosses it off the bedside table, where it lands with a clang, and rolls over onto her back. A tangled mess of messy brown hair sprawls across the pillow.

Her phone begins to blow up with a flurry of texts from her ex, Pete, each one more sarcastic than the last. Annie reaches over to silence it, but not before catching a glimpse of the obnoxious selfie he's sent. She facepalms, tossing the phone back onto the bed.

Annie's apartment resembles a tornado went through it. Clothes are strewn about the floor, takeout boxes litter the countertops, and the smell of last night's pizza hangs in the air. It's a reflection of her chaotic life – one that's equal parts chaotic and completely out of control.

As she sits up, her eyes land on the eviction notice taped to the fridge. Annie's mind goes blank, and for a moment, time stops. She stares blankly at the paper, wondering how things escalated to this point. But even in this moment of uncertainty, Annie's already formulating a plan to fix it, or at least make it slightly less terrible.
