<Current>
{current}
</Current>

Human: Do the following steps:

1. Identify some good potential story or character arcs by examining the story so far and the top-of-mind notes. The arcs may not be complete as they are, but there should be potential for them to develop based on the way the story has already played out.

2. Pick the top one based on complexity and adherence to the {narrative} style. That is, which story or character arc has the longest sequence of events to complete in the preferred style. Identify where, in the arc, the story so far is.

3. Output the arc using the following format:

<Plot>
  1 - Plot beat #1
  2 - Plot beat #2
  ...
  N - Plot beat #n
</Plot>

4. Output your reasoning inside <Reasoning> XML tags
