</History>

<Current>
{current}
</Current>

Human: Do the following steps:

1. Identify some good potential story or character arcs by examining the story so far and the top-of-mind notes. The arcs may not be complete as they are, but there should be potential for them to develop based on the way the story has already played out.

2. Pick the top one based on complexity and adherence to the {narrative} style. That is, which story or character arc has the longest sequence of events to complete in the {narrative} style. Identify where, in the arc, the story so far is.

3. Summarize the story so far in a single paragraph.

4. Output the story summary and the arc you've chosen, starting from where in the arc the story has progressed to. Use the following format for your output:

<Plot>
  1 - Story summary
  2 - Plot beat
  3 - Plot beat
  ...
  N - Plot beat
</Plot>

Don't include anything other than the story summary and the plot beats of the arc you've chose inside the <Plot> XML.

5. Output your reasoning inside <Reasoning> XML tags
