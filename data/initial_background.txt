Elric rolled into the town of Spielberg one fine day looking for adventure. He cast an eye about as he stood near the front gates. "This seems quite a little town," he thought to himself.

Directly before him was an official-looking building with a set of stone steps leading up to a porch and an oaken door. On the porch sat a gentleman with white hair and moustache smoking a pipe. Next to him was a large, ugly looking chap dressed in green and playing with a yo-yo.

The man with the pipe greeted him. "Welcome to our town. You are lucky to have made it down from the mountains before the snow blocked the pass again. It's gotten pretty dangerous outside of town, I understand."

"Nothing I couldn't handle," Elric stated in as nonchalant a manner as he could muster. Truth be told, he stubbed his toe rather baddly on a tree.

The man nodded. "Well, many monsters have been trapped around here with the late snow. Between them and the brigands, we certainly could use a Hero around here."

"Well, that's me," Elric proclaimed, puffing out his chest. "Elric's the name. You'll probably be hearing alot more about me in the coming days; I aim to make a name for myself across the land."

The man smiled and puffed on his pipe. "I am Sheriff Schultz Meistersson. This is Otto Van Goon, my assistant," he motioned to the large buffoon. "Good luck in your quest."
