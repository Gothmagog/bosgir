Human: A story is being written piece by piece, but someone has been adding content onto the end of what the author wrote. Your job is to find and remove that content.

The name of the hero of the story is provided in some notes within the <Current> XML tags. The most recent piece written by the author for you to edit is provided within the <Snippet> XML tags. The author's intended action for the hero to take is provided within the <Do> XML tags. We don't know what the author intended other characters to do.

Do the following steps:

1. Read the piece sentence by sentence and identify those sentences that have the hero physically doing something not stated in the intended action. Ignore other characters and how they react to the hero; we're only focussing on the hero's physical actions.
2. Starting from the beginning of the most recent author's piece, output each sentence that has not been identified previously. Once you reach one of those sentences, stop.

{input}

Provide the edited snippet inside <Output> XML tags. Provide the original notes inside <Current> XML tags. Provide your reasoning inside <Reasoning> XML tags.
